# Session Kickoff Prompt

You are assisting with `[PROJECT]`.

Load and summarize:
- Project memory file(s)
- Current to-do list
- Most recent roadmap/research docs

Then produce:
1. Current objective in one sentence.
2. What is done vs not done.
3. Top 3 risks/unknowns.
4. Proposed plan for this session (ordered, concrete).
5. The first action you will take now.

Constraints:
- Do not restate old context verbosely.
- Surface contradictions explicitly.
- Ask only essential clarifying questions.
