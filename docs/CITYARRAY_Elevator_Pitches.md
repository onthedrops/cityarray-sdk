# CITYARRAY Elevator Pitches

## The One-Liner

**"One detection. Fifteen languages. Two seconds."**

---

## 30-Second Pitch (Universal)

"During the LA fires, residents died because emergency alerts came too late — or not at all. CITYARRAY solves this. We're an AI-powered emergency communication platform that detects threats, translates alerts into 15 languages instantly, and displays them on LED signs throughout a venue or city. When cell networks fail, our system keeps working. One detection. Fifteen languages. Two seconds. That's the difference between chaos and safety."

---

## 60-Second Pitch (City Officials)

"Every emergency manager faces the same nightmare: how do you warn 75,000 people in 15 languages when cell towers are overwhelmed and your PA system only covers half the venue?

CITYARRAY is an AI-powered emergency communication platform. Our smart LED displays use computer vision to detect threats, pull real-time weather and emergency data, and instantly broadcast multilingual alerts — no human translation delay, no network dependency.

During the LA wildfires, communities with diverse populations received English-only alerts, or no alerts at all. Our system would have displayed evacuation routes in Spanish, Korean, Vietnamese, and Chinese simultaneously.

We're not replacing your emergency systems. We're the last mile that actually reaches everyone. One detection. Fifteen languages. Two seconds."

---

## 60-Second Pitch (Festival/Event Organizers)

"Astroworld. Itaewon. When crowd crushes happen, you have seconds to communicate — but your attendees speak a dozen languages and can't hear over the music.

CITYARRAY is an AI-powered display network that solves this. Our units detect crowd density in real-time, and when danger approaches, they flash warnings in 15 languages simultaneously. No waiting for translators. No PA system that nobody hears.

But it's not just emergencies. Our displays show set times, wayfinding, weather alerts, and exit routing — all automatically. Your ops center can push custom messages to any zone instantly.

After a pilot at your event, you'll have data showing exactly how crowd flow improved and response times dropped. That's the ROI that protects your brand and your attendees."

---

## 60-Second Pitch (Investors)

"The emergency communication market is broken. Everbridge charges $38,000 per year and still requires human translators. FEMA's IPAWS reaches phones — but what happens when 75,000 people overwhelm the cell network?

CITYARRAY is the physical layer that's missing. We combine edge AI, computer vision, and instant translation into smart LED displays that work when everything else fails.

Our MVP is built: Raspberry Pi 5, Hailo AI accelerator, 15-language support, voice interaction, real-time weather and emergency data. Hardware cost under $800 per unit.

We're targeting festivals first — $2B market, desperate for crowd safety solutions post-Astroworld. Then smart cities, transportation hubs, and enterprise campuses.

Our moat is the AI: scene understanding, not just object detection. The system knows the difference between a crowd having fun and a crowd in danger.

We're raising $500K to scale from prototype to 50-unit pilot deployments. The first festivals are already asking."

## Pitch by Use Case

### Smart Cities

"Cities spend millions on emergency systems that fail the people who need them most — non-English speakers, tourists, and residents in areas with poor cell coverage.

CITYARRAY deploys AI-powered LED displays throughout your city. When the National Weather Service issues an alert, our system displays it in 15 languages within 2 seconds. When air quality hits dangerous levels, residents see warnings in their language. When disaster strikes and cell networks fail, our mesh network keeps communicating.

We integrate with IPAWS, your existing emergency systems, and traffic infrastructure. We don't replace what you have — we make it reach everyone."

**Key Benefits:**
- 15+ languages, instant translation
- Works offline when networks fail
- Integrates with IPAWS and NWS
- AI threat detection built-in
- 70% lower cost than competitors

### Festivals & Large Events

"Your attendees come from everywhere, speak different languages, and can't hear announcements over the music. When something goes wrong, you have seconds to reach them.

CITYARRAY places smart LED displays throughout your venue. They show set times and wayfinding during normal operations. But when crowd density spikes, weather threatens, or emergency strikes, they instantly display warnings in every language your attendees speak.

Our AI detects crowd crush conditions before humans notice. Our displays work even when cell networks are overwhelmed. Your ops center controls everything from a single dashboard."

**Key Benefits:**
- Crowd density monitoring
- Instant multilingual alerts
- Schedule and wayfinding integration
- Works without cell network
- Reduces liability exposure

---

### Transportation Hubs (Airports, Stations)

"Airports and transit stations are uniquely vulnerable: high density, diverse languages, and critical evacuation requirements. Your current PA system assumes everyone speaks English and can hear.

CITYARRAY displays provide visual, multilingual emergency communication at every gate, platform, and corridor. Our AI detects unusual crowd behavior and alerts your operations center. When you need to evacuate, every display shows exit routes in the languages your travelers speak.

We integrate with your existing systems — flight boards, security cameras, and emergency protocols. Installation is modular and doesn't require infrastructure changes."

**Key Benefits:**
- 15+ languages for international travelers
- Visual alerts for hearing-impaired
- AI crowd monitoring
- Integrates with existing displays
- Zone-specific messaging

---

### Corporate Campuses

"Your employees and visitors speak multiple languages. Your emergency PA reaches some buildings but not others. Your fire drill compliance is a spreadsheet nightmare.

CITYARRAY provides AI-powered displays throughout your campus. During normal operations, they show meeting room availability, weather, and company announcements. During emergencies, they display evacuation routes, muster points, and safety instructions in every language your workforce speaks.

Our system logs every alert, every response, and every evacuation time — giving you the compliance documentation you need."

**Key Benefits:**
- Multilingual workforce support
- Automated compliance logging
- Integrates with building management
- Voice interaction for information
- Weather and air quality alerts

---

### Schools & Universities

"When lockdown happens, every second matters. Your PA system reaches classrooms, but what about the quad, the parking lot, the stadium?

CITYARRAY displays throughout your campus provide instant visual alerts that reach everyone — including deaf and hard-of-hearing students. Our AI can detect unusual activity and alert security before a human calls it in.

During normal operations, displays show event schedules, weather, and campus announcements. During emergencies, they show exactly what to do and where to go."

**Key Benefits:**
- RUN HIDE FIGHT instant display
- Reaches outdoor areas
- Accessibility for deaf/HoH students
- AI threat detection
- Parent notification integration

## Objection Handlers

### "We already have an emergency system."

"Great — we integrate with it. CITYARRAY is the physical display layer that makes your alerts visible to everyone, especially when cell networks are overwhelmed or people don't speak English. We enhance what you have, not replace it."

### "It's too expensive."

"Our hardware costs under $800 per unit. Compare that to $5,000+ for commercial digital signage. And unlike Everbridge at $38K/year, our software runs locally — no recurring cloud fees for basic operation."

### "What about false alarms?"

"Our tiered authorization system requires human confirmation for high-severity alerts. Informational and advisory messages run autonomously, but emergency evacuations require ops center approval. You control the sensitivity."

### "Does it work without internet?"

"Yes. That's our key differentiator. Each unit has onboard AI, cached emergency protocols, and mesh networking to other units. When cell towers go down — exactly when you need emergency comms most — we keep working."

### "Who else is using it?"

"We're in pilot discussions with [events/cities]. Our technology stack is proven: the same Hailo AI chips are used in automotive safety systems, and our Whisper speech recognition is from OpenAI. We're bringing enterprise-grade AI to emergency communications."

## The Close

"Can I show you a 3-minute demo? You'll see the system detect a person, display alerts in 5 languages, pull live weather data, and respond to voice commands. Then let's talk about a pilot at your next event."
